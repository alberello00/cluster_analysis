# Cluster analysis
Welcome to the Cluster Analysis Techniques Exploration repository! Here, we embark on a comprehensive journey through various cluster analysis methods, unraveling their applications, strengths, and practical implementations.

# Key Features:

# K-Means Clustering:
Dive into one of the most widely used clustering techniques, understanding how it partitions data into distinct clusters based on similarity.

# Hierarchical Clustering:
Explore the hierarchical approach to clustering, where data points are successively grouped into clusters, forming a tree-like structure.
